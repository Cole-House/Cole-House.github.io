<h2> Where it all began </h2>

Growing up I enjoyed most of my time running around outside playing soccer or just wreaking havoc in the neighborhood like all kids do. I enjoyed browsing the internet and  playing all sorts of games like the cartoon network games, congregate.com and also on my gameboy. These were the only electronic devices that mattered to me in that moment of time, but as I got older my eyes were opened to a new world of possibilities. Starting in high-school, I signed up for an elective called STEM which I thought would be more focused on Engineering and Math but instead it focused almost mainly on "coding" which was completely foreign to me. I really found a liking towards it and programming when I could see that with my laptop and problem solving skills I could make simple HTML websites and make them interactive with JavaScript... but this was just the tip of the Iceberg.

<h2> What's Next? </h2>

As I quickly came to understand through my first year and a half as a Computer Science Major with technology constantly on the rise the field is vast and growing, practically touching upon every industry there is. Having made simple programs in Java and C which took quite some time to understand and implement, I always think of the various applications, websites, and softwares I use on the daily and how those are made by a team spending countless hours of work and writing hundreds of thousands lines of code all to make something that can be used by people worldwide and functions properly. Creating applications or programs that provide use to real world problems and issues inspire me as a Computer Science student.

My hopes for this semester is to apply what I learn in class to build a project that I can add to my portfolio, and feel good about. This project is still yet to be determined but it with time it will hone my skills as a programmer, practicing what I learn in class and also pushing me to problem solve with independent studying. Looking at the modules to come, I am excited to be introduced to a bunch of new frameworks like React, Meteor, MongoDB and also learn how to use them and what I can make with them. I don't know if we will be exposed to API's but those peak my interest as well. With this class I hop to build upon my foundation in programming, coding, and problem solving so I can find my niche that I am genuinely interested in and helps make a mark on the world.
