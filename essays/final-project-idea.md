<h2> Overview </h2>

  PROBLEM: After two years in a pandemic and we are slowly but surely returning to regular life, but some people have gotten really accustomed to staying indoors, hanging out virtually, and talking to each other through screens. There are also people who may feel lonely and want to go outside and make new friends, some who previously relied on in-person gatherings as their sole platform for socializing.
  
  SOLUTION: To help solve this problem our group brainstormed and came up with a final project that is similar to [meetup hawaii]("https://www.meetup.com/find/?source=EVENTS&categoryId=535&location=us--hawaii") which is a site where users can find events where people that share a common interest can meetup, student organizers can organize events and it would be exclusive to students from UH
  
<h2> Approach </h2>

  UH Meetup is an easy-to-use web application where the students at the UH campuses are eligible to be users and also organizers on the site. This provides a secure space for UH students to connect with one another and meet people they normally would not get the opportunity to engage with. The main idea of this site is to incorporate the networking aspect of regular social media sites such as Instagram, Facebook, etc. However, once users have connected with one another, we would like to encourage them to move their conversations from the website to real life. Sharing real life experiences and putting yourself out there is a great way to network and form lasting friendships. When making a profile, users can create a bio, add a profile picture, social media handle(suggested), as well as their interests/hobbies so others are able to view. With the user's interests we can add some "special sauce" by pushing the meetup tabs of their interests to the top and other meetups lower on the page. There will also be a feature that gives you a random meetup to view from the database. 
  
As a user of the web app you can:
- View all meetups in different categories
- Click “Attend” on the meetups they mean to attend
- Post questions for an meetup
- Edit your Bio
- View other user’s Bios
- View meetups you plan on attending

There will also be an option to login as an “Organiser”, and as an “Organiser” you have the capabilities to:
- View all meetups
- Post meetup for users to view and attend
- Edit/Cancel your posted meetups 
- Answer questions posted on your meetups

Some Mockup Pages include:
- Landing
- Login
- New User 
- Home 
- Various Meetup Lists for different interests
- Meetup Display 
- Bio 
- Make/Edit Meetup 


<h2> Use Cases </h2>
