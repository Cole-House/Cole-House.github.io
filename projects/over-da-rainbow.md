  Over Da Rainbow is the name of a meteor web application which used the [meteor-application-template-react](“https://ics-software-engineering.github.io/meteor-application-template-react/”) and was developed by Ruben Jacobo, Timothy Ro, Kevin Nahinu, and myself as our final project for our Software Engineering class. This app is designed to help University of Hawaii students step outside their dorms and classrooms to explore beautiful sceneries and destinations offered on Oahu responsibly with a sense of community. Along with information about locations across the island on the application you can learn about various campus spots, volunteer opportunities and leave reviews documenting your experiences for any location/spot in the database. You can learn more about our application and view the source code through our GitHub home page [here](“https://over-da-rainbow.github.io/”) and view our deployed site using Digital Ocean [here](“https://overdarainbow.xyz/#/”).

## My Contributions to the project:
* Came up with the name for the application
* Logo (with help of Gage Minamoto)
*  Helped with the research of different locations for data entry
* Modifying the Signup Form to take info for UserProfile
* Built the User Profile Page that displays the user’s info
* Used Semantic UI React to build Location Cards from the database records
* Review Modal Form (that includes Review Collection and Schema)
* Implement functionality of clicking on other user’s usernames and taking them to their profile.
